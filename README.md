* Theme and Theory
  
  Practicing Yin Yoga before bedtime is a fantastic way to release any mental or physical tension. It can help people enjoy a peaceful night and get a deep sleep. Developing a nighttime routine may improve sleeping quality. 

  Practicing Yoga in the dark is also a powerful way to connect with mind and body. Yoga is all about a mind-body connection that is achieved by filtering out the world around you and finding peace and awareness within.

  Simple and attractive images and dim colours such as dark gray or color #171212 #0a0a0 can create an inviting and thematic atmosphere.   
  
  Beautiful pictures are important to draw people’s attention and colours like dark gray and the other can instantly bring anybody into a relaxed state. These things also add a trusty and professional feeling to the brand.
  
  Colour psychology teaches that colours have a big influence on people’s behaviors and moods. Well-selected colours can convince users to take action and purchase products or sign up for your mailing list.
