                <p>Hi, I’m Katie. I teach gentle, relaxing yoga to help people calm their minds and release tension in their bodies.</p>
                <p>I have been practising yoga since I was a teenager and teaching it since 2020. Before becoming a yoga teacher I worked in various different office jobs. Working at a desk all day made my body feel very tense, especially my neck, shoulders, back and hips. Practising yoga helped release that tension. Yoga also helped calm my mind and helped me cope with the stresses of working in a busy, fast-paced environment.</p>
                <p>I am currently building my yoga business and my target market is office workers. To test the market, I would like to offer one free class on zoom for office workers. Please check schedule for availability. It will be a yin yoga class. Yin yoga is a slow, gentle practice. It is all seated and lying down postures. It is very relaxing, great to do before bed!</p>

            <h2>What is Yin Yoga?</h2>
    
                <p>Yin Yoga is a slow-paced style of yoga as exercise, incorporating principles of traditional Chinese medicine, with asanas (postures) that are held for longer periods of time than in other styles. For beginners, asanas may be held from 45 seconds to two minutes; more advanced practitioners may stay in one asana for five minutes or more. The sequences of postures are meant to stimulate the channels of the subtle body known as meridians in Chinese medicine and as nadis in Hatha yoga.</p>
                <p>Yin Yoga poses apply moderate stress to the connective tissues of the body—the tendons, fasciae, and ligaments—with the aim of increasing circulation in the joints and improving flexibility. A more meditative approach to yoga, its goals are awareness of inner silence, and bringing to light a universal, interconnecting quality.</p>
                <p>Yin Yoga was founded in the late 1970s by martial arts expert and yoga teacher Paulie Zink Taoist yoga (Tao Yin). Yin Yoga is taught across North America and Europe, encouraged by its teachers Paul Grilley and Sarah Powers. As taught by Grilley and Powers, it is not intended as a complete practice in itself, but as a complement to more active forms of yoga and exercise. However, Zink's approach includes the full range of Taoist yoga, both yin and conventional.</p>
